  After the work by Quinton, we propose to thin Debian Images on EC2 (like AMI)
  using our MISC solvers.

  The script thinnit.sh takes as parameter a file containing the package metadata
  (possibly a concatenation of Debian Packages files), and an optional set of packages one
  wants installed on top of the base system (a comma-separated list of package names),
  and produces as output a CUDF file containing the list of packages needed for the
  installation with minimal installed size (the size in Kb of this installation and
  the number of packages required are output by the script on the last line: just
  ignore the the leading - signs).

REQUIREMENTS:
  To run the toolchain, you need:

   - aspcud, version 1.7 or later, from http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/aspcud/
     (the version in Debian experimental, as of 2012.10.24-1 is fine) 
     make sure the executable aspcud is the aspcud-full one

   - ceve, which is one of the applications compiled by default in the
     Dose library from https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/dose/
     (the version of ceve in Debian as of 1.4-2 is not recent enough)

   - cudf_solution_checker from https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/misc-competitio/
